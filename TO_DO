List of things to do:

* Find/investigate compatibility with other friend-seeking Bluetooth
  applications 

* Keep a list of interesting names, countries and other profile information,
  so that when a matching profile appeares the user gets a special
  notification.

* Possibility to send small e-mail type messages to other users or
  communities. These messages would be saved and one could reply to them.

* Implement deletion of expired temporary files

* Optimize community meta data lookups

* Wait for zombies spawned from openfile.py

* Add "leave community" menu option

* Community based content search and visualization

* Key exchange -> join into private personal community

* filesharing.native_path vs serve_fname
* Query options class
* Add "community chat" button to community member view
* mtime check to meta cache

* There are lots of communities. It is not possible to show them all.
  - Search communities functionality

* Friend status into user profiles: some kind of special notification
  about friends in close proximity
  - friend popup dialog when friend appears

* Need 'All users' community view that contains all users from the database.
  Add a menu item that goes into 'all users' community.
  - Should we show offline users in personal communities?

* Temporary join into a community so that chat messages are routed properly;
  Starting message plugin for a community implies a temporary join to the
  channel.

* Implement "open download directory" for workstation Linux systems

* Make send file transfer dialog visible before user has accepted the
 transfer

* Add a cancel button to the send file transfer dialog

* Give a more verbose notification when opening U2U chat (high priority
  notification maybe)

* Main view's "Messages" button should pop up a menu that has two choices:
  "message board" and "message in a bottle"

* A better progress indicator GUI

* 2010-01-15 feedback:
  - show myself in personal communities as well to be consistent with
    peer communities
  - make key exchange with two key presses (visual hash comparison)
  - show a visual difference between peer and personal communities in
    the main view
  - radar:
    - avoid user icon interleaving in radar plugin
    - make user icons smaller in radar plugin
    - put icons _between_ arcs, not intersecting arcs, with respect
      to hop distance
  - not possible to publish msg board items to a given community. they
    always go to the whole proximate commununity.

* Audit replies that containt 0 answers. The reply message can be something
  that need not be sent over network.

* BUG: automatic scrolling does not always work in chat

* Display downloader's nick with file transfers

* In filesharing, directory metadata is read-only

* Create a FUSE filesystem for a remote fileshare

* Fix SHA1 sums of messages; message concatenation for SHA1 needs a separator
  value to avoid ambiguity

* Do not trust Share_Meta 'src' field (reject my uid from others)
