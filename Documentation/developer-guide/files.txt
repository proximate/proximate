User and community profiles, and Proximate configuration are stored under
$HOME/.proximate directory. Each user and community has a directory under
that directory that contains relevant data associated with the user or
community. Most data is stored in ".ini file format". See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ini for overview.

user profiles::
     Directory $HOME/.proximate/u_0123456789abcdef contains
     profile and data related to user with an uid 0123456789abcdef.

community profiles::
     Directory $HOME/.proximate/c_%d, where %d is a decimal coded integer,
     are directories related to communities.

Proximate configuration::
     File $HOME/.proximate/config contains users personal identity, main window
     dimensions etc. Note, user can assume other user's identity by two
     means:

     1. Use -t option to set Proximate config directory other than
     $HOME/.proximate. This option is useful for testing two clients
     simultaneously on the same host.
     2. Use --identity=uid option to
     select a known identity from the database.
