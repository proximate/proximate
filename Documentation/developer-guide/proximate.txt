Proximate
====

Proximate is a peer-to-peer social networking tool that was especially
designed for ad hoc WLAN, but it (of course) works on common IP
networks too.  It is completely peer-to-peer, which means that all
parties are equal. The application does not trust any party by
default, unless the user instructs it to trust someone.

Users can share files, send messages, chat, send mail, podcast new content
into the network. The content propagates manually and automatically in the
network.

Proximate program consists, roughly, from plugins, utility modules and GUI.
GUI logic is separated from the underlying core logic so that the GUI
can be changed independently of the core logic. This helps porting for
other platforms. However, GUI is not especially modular currently, so
porting for another GUI kit is far from trivial.

Brief summary of technical features:

* Implemented with peer-to-peer principles (all peers are equal)
* Coded with Python (portable between Linux/GTK systems)
* GUI and core logic is separated -> there is potential for a port to
  another UI toolkit
* Single threaded (in glib event loop)
* Asynchronous communication based on callbacks (uses TCP sockets)
* Peer discovery through UDP broadcasts in local network
  (non-local networking is not currently supported, but it has been
  planned)
* Implements yet another filesharing push/pull protocol
  - A user may publish zero or more files or directories with meta data
* Listens to a single TCP port
* Peer-to-peer community chat protocol
* Uses bencode serialization protocol (from the BitTorrent protocol),
  and a some compact custom protocols implemented for Proximate
* Uses plugin design pattern; most functionality is implemented in
  plugins (classes derived from the Plugin class)
* Compact network protocol (non-bloated, unlike XML)
