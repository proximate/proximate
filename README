Proximate - Peer-to-peer social networking

Proximate is a social peer-to-peer (P2P) application designed for local 
device to device networking.

Proximate provides social communities with several user functions: 
Messaging, filesharing, and message board. The application is designed 
to be completely P2P, that is, servers are not needed. It only assumes 
TCP/IP networking which means that it works over wireless/wired links 
such as ad hoc WLAN and Ethernet LAN. The application is written in 
Python for GNU/Linux systems with GTK+ GUI, Nokia N900 being the primary 
platform.

Proximate was created in co-operation between Tampere University of
Technology and Nokia Research Center. The project started at the
beginning of 2008.
